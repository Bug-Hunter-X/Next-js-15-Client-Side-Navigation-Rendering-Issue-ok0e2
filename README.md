# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where client-side navigations sometimes fail to render the expected content, leading to a blank page or an error. The issue appears to stem from the interplay between React's rendering mechanisms and Next.js 15's updated rendering pipeline.

## Bug Description

When navigating between pages within a Next.js 15 application, the client-side rendering occasionally fails, resulting in a blank screen or a runtime error. This is inconsistent and doesn't occur every time. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between pages within the application (e.g., click links that trigger client-side transitions). Observe that sometimes the rendering is successful, and sometimes it results in a blank screen or error.

## Workaround

The provided solution shows how to mitigate this issue by leveraging a combination of techniques to ensure consistent client-side rendering.
